I want to find my place in the IT sphere.
I'm engaged in *UI/UX, web-design*. And for me it's really interesting to continue the project and not to stop on the design.
I'm very ambitious. When I start doing something, it's never enough for me. I want to learn more and more, set new goals and achieve them.

**When we learn something,** we become better. When we learn front-end development, **we help people in the whole world** to get access to web-sites and also learn from them.
